# LiveSync

LiveSync is a modular graph-based framework designed for real-time media processing and synchronization. It provides an elegant solution for building complex media processing pipelines while maintaining precise timing and synchronization between different data streams.

## Why LiveSync?

- **Graph-Based Architecture**: Build complex processing pipelines using a simple, intuitive DAG structure
- **Real-Time Processing**: Optimized for handling continuous data streams with minimal latency
- **Flexible Node System**: Create custom processing nodes or use pre-built ones for common media operations
- **Async-First Design**: Leverages Python's asyncio for efficient concurrent processing

## Get Started

New to LiveSync? Follow the [Installation Guide](getting-started/installation.md) to set up your environment and run your first pipeline.
